TODO: 

   change listbox into individual buttons (blue w/ pokemon font text)

        -- DONE. changed the font to Montserrat instead

        -- added code to preserve the button's clicked state to represent
        what pokemon type we're viewing so I don't have to add it to the
        output container

   break detailsDiv into separate output containers

   move moves closer to moves

        -- so when you click on a "move" its details will be adjacent
